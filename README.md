RFID Attendance System with Automatic Mail Sending

📌 Overview :
This project is an RFID-based Attendance System that automates attendance tracking using RFID technology. It records attendance in a database and sends real-time email notifications upon check-in/out. Additionally, the system can be configured to send a daily attendance report at a specific time. 


🎯 Features :
RFID Authentication – Quick and secure attendance marking using RFID cards/tags.

Automatic Email Notification – Sends real-time email alerts upon check-in/out.

Scheduled Email Reports – Sends a summary of attendance records at a set time each day.

Database Integration – Stores attendance logs for future reference.

User Interface – Displays attendance status on an LCD screen or web dashboard.

Scalable & Efficient – Can be implemented in schools, offices, and organizations.


🛠️ Tech Stack :
Hardware: RFID Reader, RFID Tags, Arduino (or Raspberry Pi)

Software: Python/C++ (microcontroller programming), MySQL (database), SMTP (email sending)

Communication: Serial Communication (UART), Wi-Fi Module (if applicable)


🚀 How It Works :
A user taps an RFID card/tag on the RFID reader.

The system reads the RFID ID and verifies it in the database.

If valid, attendance is recorded, and an email notification is sent.

The system can also generate a daily attendance report and send it via email at a predefined time.


🔥 Applications :
Schools & Universities – For student attendance tracking.

Offices & Workplaces – For employee check-in/out monitoring.

Events & Conferences – For visitor management.
